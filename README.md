# Welcome to June Tracker!
I'm [June Tracker's](https://youtu.be/t2qYNk9TSeg) personal health assistant. I was created in the [NASA Space Apps](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/) challenge to help you assess your coronavirus symptoms (COVID-19).
It's a Google Action, that uses DialogFlow.

## How many people need to die?
The Brazilian health system will collapse, and that is a fact.
So, how many people need to die for us to **use data for better decisions**?

## Context
On May 30th, Brazil had **498,440** confirmed cases and **28,834** deaths and used **72.4%** of intensive treatment structures directed to a COVID19. We know that the case curve is accelerating. And in the coming weeks, we will have greater use of the hospital infrastructure and higher social fear.
 
## Why now?
Why we are already using more than **70%** of the hospital capacity available for the treatment of Covid19 in Brazil and we know that the number of cases is highly likely to increase. At this stage of the way, we can no longer neglect the use of intelligence to optimize available hospital capacity, map risk areas and effectively guide people who may be infected by the disease.

## Other considerations
This project consists of June Tracker (this one) and [Covid Tracker](https://github.com/dlsouza42/CovidTracker) (prediction algorithm), when together they become a strong tool in combating Covid 19 and the collapse of the health system.
